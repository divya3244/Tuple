 Write a program to get the tuple values in a single line separated by space and count the nuber of times the given x value is present in the given tuple.
Sample Input:
1 2 3 1 2 3 4 1 2 1
1
Sample Output:
4


answer:
def count_value_in_tuple():
    user_input = input("10 ")
    elements = tuple(map(int, user_input.split()))
    x = int(input("4"))
    
    count = elements.count(x)
    print(count)

count_value_in_tuple()


output:
10  1
4 2
0
